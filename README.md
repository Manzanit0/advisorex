# Advisor

This little app sprung to life as an attempt to improve upon the current peer-feedback process.
The main point is to provide valuable insight by giving and advice and avoiding generic feedback.

Advisor allows you to create a form from a catalog of questions and lets you direct that form to specific people.
This makes the insights more targeted to your current situation.

It also pushes the responsibility to collect and track the results away from a central authority and out the mentee/group lead pairs.

Hopefully, this app will delight you by guiding you through a swift creation process.

# Running the server

  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
