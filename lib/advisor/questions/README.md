# Question

Here we can find any question that can be [answered](lib/advisor/answers/README.md').
Find questions based on their ids questions or just all of them.
The questions are kept in a YAML file to ease collaboration.

For the moment we are targeting three kinds of questions:
1. Technical
2. Client Relationships
3. Community


## Changes

If we introduce more varied ways to display or look for questions, we'll likely need to modify this file.
