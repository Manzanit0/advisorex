# Questions

Here we can find any question that can be [answered](lib/advisor/core/answers/README.md').
Find all questions, or a subset basded on ids or the [questionnaire](/lib/advisor/core/questionnaire/README.md)

For the moment we are targeting three kinds of questions:
1. Technical
2. Client Relationships
3. Community

The questions are kept in a YAML file to ease collaboration.

## Changes

If we introduce more varied ways to display or look for questions, we'll likely need to modify this file.
