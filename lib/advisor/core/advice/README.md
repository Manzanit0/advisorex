# Advice

Advice is what an advisor will give to a requester.
Its the collection of [answers](lib/advisor/core/answers/README.md) to [questions](lib/advisor/core/questions/README.md) from an existing [questionnaire](lib/advisor/core/questionnaire/README).

This module allows  you to find any advice request, or one tied to a specic [person](lib/advisor/core/people/README.md) or questionnaire.

## Changes

We'll likely add different ways to find these advice entities over time. Those changes would likely happen here.
